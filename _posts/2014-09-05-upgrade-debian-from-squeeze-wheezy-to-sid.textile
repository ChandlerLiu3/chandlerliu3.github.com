now the stable version of debian is 'wheezy', its former release is 'squeeze'.

Here might be a common way to upgrade from one debian release to another.

h3. 1. clear the original release

<pre>
  apt-get update  # update the original package 
  apt-get upgrade # finish this to make a clear base to real upgrade
  apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

h3. 2. make sure it is ready

  @aptitude@

just press 'g', let it run by itself to clear all not finished task

h3. 3. change the /etc/apt/source.list to the next release name

we cannot jump over some release typically, well, I did not try this.

h3. 4. repeat the step 1.
